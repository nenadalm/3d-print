## [Cleaver handle](./cleaver_handle.scad)

<img alt="cleaver handle" height="240" src="docs/cleaver_handle.jpg">

An old cleaver that was missing a handle.

## [Door knob](./doorknob.scad)

<img alt="helmet nut" height="240" src="docs/doorknob.jpg">

It started as a replacement for a door handle so that our dog couldn't open the door leading to the outside/inside (as she never closed the door after going through), but was later used for many other doors inside.

## [Drawer handle](./drawer_handle.scad)

<img alt="drawer handle" height="240" src="docs/drawer_handle.jpg">

Replacement for broken handles on an older table.

## [Etager stand](./etager_stand.scad)

<img alt="etager stand" height="240" src="docs/etager_stand.jpg">

Replacement for missing etager stand.

## [Faucet adapter](./faucet_adapter.scad)

<img alt="faucet adapter" height="240" src="docs/faucet_adapter.jpg">

Since the wood around the faucet got a bit rotten, the faucet was sinking into the wood. Therefore, I've created this adapter, under which I placed a bit of rubber from old car medkit to prevent slipping and sealed it with sanitary silicone to prevent water getting under the adapter.

## [Flowerpot](./flowerpot.scad)

<img alt="faucet adapter" height="240" src="docs/flowerpot.jpg">

## [Helmet nut](./helmet_nut.scad)

<img alt="helmet nut" height="240" src="docs/helmet_nut.jpg">

I've lost the original nut somewhere, so I printed new one.

## [Hoover SteamJet lid](./hoover_steamjet_lid.scad)

<img alt="Hoover SteamJet lid" height="240" src="docs/hoover_steamjet_lid.jpg">

Old lid was cut in half as it was impossible to open, so new one was created.

## [Igra hockey knob](./igra_hockey__knob.scad)

<img alt="helmet nut" height="240" src="docs/igra_hockey_knob.jpg">

Old knobs were cracked and couldn't grip the rods anymore. These new ones work great and have better grip with fingers.

## [Knife handle](./knife_handle.scad)

<img alt="knife handle" height="240" src="docs/knife_handle.jpg">

Long time ago I received an old knife with handle made of some animal paw (deer?). But that broke off, so I was left with knife without handle.

Image of similar knife I found on the internet: https://www.uton.cz/nuz-csla-vo-7/vo7-foto/

## [Lamp bulb holder](./lamp_bulb_holder.scad)

<img alt="lamp bulb holder" height="240" src="docs/lamp_bulb_holder.jpg">
